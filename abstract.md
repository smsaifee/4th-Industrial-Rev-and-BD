# Abstract

The Revolution isn't only about manufacturing; it's pervasive throughout society and promotes diversified innovation via digital technology. Digital, physical, and biological technologies are the engines of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The magnitude of the effect and the rapidity with which the changes occur set this transition apart from any other in human history. These shifts result from sophisticated technology that will eventually replace human labor with automation and robots. The magnitude, pace, and breadth of the changes are unprecedented.

While the profound uncertainty surrounding the development and adoption of emerging technologies means we don't yet know how the industrial revolution's transformations will play out, their complexity and interconnectedness across sectors mean that all stakeholders in a global society – governments, businesses, academia, and civil society – have a responsibility to work together to understand the emerging trends better.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is based on and builds on the preceding revolution from an evolutionary standpoint. It is commonly referred to as the "Digital Revolution" since it promotes digital technology. Its goal involves merging technologies that bring the physical and biological worlds closer together.

The current paper examines the constraints and prospects of technical advancements in Bangladesh, beginning with a short overview of earlier industrial revolutions. Bangladesh has been on a development path and receives the least amount of technical support. Even the present administration has shown a strong interest in technological progress, which will serve as the foundation for a developed Bangladesh in 2041. This paper depicts Bangladesh's position in this vast area of potential.

In this research, a systematic review technique was used, and prior studies were considered. This research established a conceptual foundation by employing 4IR in various domains. This study is critical because we need to figure out what 4IR is and where it belongs before getting into the rest of the development process. Insignificant institutions are still weak despite their vast potential. This paper looked at the possibilities, challenges, and possible solutions to problems that could happen in Bangladesh in the future.

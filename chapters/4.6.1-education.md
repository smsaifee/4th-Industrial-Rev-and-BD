### 4.6.1 EDUCATION SECTOR

In the future, instead of enrolling our children in school, we may have to let them use new applications via subscription. It's only been one and a half years after the global pandemic, but reality has already worked its spell. Covid epidemics around the country have forced tens of thousands of students to utilize a digital platform to finish their education. Bangladesh's educational system and the influence of technology advancements have been the subject of much debate after this development. A massive shift is upon us. Are we prepared, or are we being pushed by the need of critical development? As a result, the first step in implementing the 4th IR in education is to identify prospective application areas. However, we must first grasp and analyze Bangladesh's existing situation. Bangladesh's educational system falls short of the high expectations set by the global economic climate. Biometrics, examination of MCQ answer papers, management of education data servers, etc., are still the most common uses of AI in education. Another avenue to success is in employing machine learning in educational settings. The government possesses a wealth of information about students and officials, and an algorithm can provide recommendations on how to best use that information. Scientific and social research should include AI-based analysis in their processes. Greater usage of artificial intelligence (AI) in education will lead to more inventive ideas. Building one's own internal resources, on the other hand, is critical. Many times, we mistakenly believe that having access to information equates to having expertise. Knowledge is significantly deeper than just facts and stats. The 4th IR provides us with a wealth of information, but there is a significant gap in our ability to access it. This is still a work in progress for the Bangladeshi educational system. The indirect impact of 4th IR in the education field is created a new form of knowledge gathering environment such as

- Internet-based critical thinking where everyone has the opportunity to collect knowledge
- Managing the vast number of students using online platforms like Zoom Google classroom.
- Increasing the emotional intelligence ability
- Easy access to the knowledge by using the internet
- The judgmental ability of students also improved by using AI-based technologies
- Reskilled populations

ICT education is another crucial part important for future development and capacity building. Already the government made more than 20 ICT high tec parks and trained around 70000 people nationwide. Most of them are previously studied in the ITC sector, but the new industrial revolution needs fresh learners. The more we include students in the technical field of study, the less we will face future technical dilemmas. The Bangladeshi education system needs more students in technological sectors to be directly involved with this industrial revolution.

The following table shows some real impacts of 4<sup>th</sup>IR elements in the educational field of Bangladesh.

| Admission,<br><br>online examination,<br><br>Remote schooling.                 | The internet makes easy access for all students on online platforms. Bangladesh has more than 30 million students nationwide, and sometimes it is nearly impossible to communicate with everyone, especially since the admission process is haphazard. Nevertheless, the recent use of an online admission system provides an easy admission pathway. Advanced machine learning systems can easily filter millions of student data and select perfect educational institutions. The admission system of higher secondary schools already follows algorithm-based results.<br><br>In the covid pandemic era, we have also faced new schooling and examination processes. |
| PDF books, use of online resources.                                            | Most modern students and teachers can get a vast amount of data. Online scholarly resources, pdf books, articles are available because of the advanced algorithms. Algorithms can also suggest and filter millions of data and provide the best possible solutions. A student has to use this opportunity and connects them with a real scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Connectivity,<br><br>Independent<br><br>Online Platforms<br><br>for education. | The age of algorithms demands high-level connectivity among students. Online platforms like 'ten-minute school' 'Shikko' have created a virtual platform where millions of students get their required academic help. Another significant advantage of these platforms is their active contribution to the business and economy. The economy is not out of any areas in this modern world so does education. We have to admit that education indeed has a vast impact on the economy. These online platforms are the start of a new education business model.                                                                                                           |

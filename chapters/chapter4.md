# Chapter4

Bangladesh has one of the fastest-growing economies and a lot of people who are willing to work. This made it a hotspot for the next industrial revolution. But Bangladesh's current social structure is just a copy of what developed countries have done to get ahead. The idea of the global village, economic freedom, trade unions, and faster communication all open up new ways for developed countries to meet international standards. On the other hand, this dimension has also created a global underclass, uneven growth, and social, racial, political, and economic inequality that is hard to get rid of. These changes made life hard for people in the third world. There are violent conflicts, structural violence, problems with migrants, and high unemployment rates across the globe. The pattern of social structural violence also got worse as social structures got better. Bangladesh can still fight against all odds and build a better future. The government favors digitalization so much that its central campaign promise was to make Bangladesh a digital country. The government of Bangladesh thinks that in 10 years, they will be in a respectable position in the ICT field because there are so many opportunities there. The Bangladesh government has already put out a National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, which outlines what the government will do in the future on AI. This is a clear answer from the government that they are also looking forward to the end being based on AI, fulfilling the 4th industrial revolution. As we all know, the current situation in Bangladesh does not meet all the requirements for the development of the 4th IR. There are many fundamental problems in our society, and it's essential to figure out what they are and how to solve them. This chapter discusses the options, effects, and different parts of 4IR in Bangladesh. The impacts and possibilities described do not always match the current situation. Instead, they are more of a hypothetical explanation of 4IR in the context of Bangladesh.

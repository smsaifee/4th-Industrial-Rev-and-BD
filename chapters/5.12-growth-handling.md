## 5.13 THE CHALLENGE TO HANDLING THE ENORMOUS GROWTH

The speed of the 4th IR is way much quicker than society expected. There is a dilemma of handling the data vs. just using them for targeted purposes. Most of the 4IR-based companies and institutions may face the problem of handling big data. Because the structural system does not control such big data, we do not give away our information. Hare a big challenge is lying under the development. The challenge of proper use and implication of data. Bangladeshi authority still has not that much to handle big data.

Furthermore, this poor data management system may create another issue of data privacy. Most companies choose a simple third-party platform to manage data to avoid data management. These third parties are the primary concern. Even organizations like Facebook have faced legal accusations of using customers' information without permission. So, where does the Bangladeshi authority stand in this regard? The answer is unclear, and I can say it is not affirmative. We just have not thought about this kind of problem. However, we faced our most significant loss in the banking system in 2016 when some North Korean hackers stole our reserve from Bangladesh's bank.

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the Bangladesh economy. In 2020, they represented 30% of absolute business and 20% of GDP. The feasible future development of Bangladesh's economy is intently attached to the presentation of the SME area. Factors like the pioneering attitude of our populace, more prominent help from the public authority, admittance to venture, and youthful labor forces have been making this area so energetic throughout the long term. These more modest ventures drive developments to tackle neighborhood issues and layout specialties in their nearby networks. Bangladesh is a land of opportunity to evolve new types of business models. The amount of skilled, educated population is increasing highly<sup>[\[71\]](#footnote-71)</sup>.

On the other hand, the rise of SMEs in the world economic scenario is increasing. Bangladeshi society and economic structure are perfect for SME business.

| Problems                       | 4IR Based Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unskilled population           | AI-based education is ideal for creating a new generation of skilled workforce.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Lack<br><br>Of government loan | Lack of governmental loans is happening due to a communication gap between the government and mass people.                                                                                                                          |
| Narrow marketing place         | Online marketing is still out of ordinary people's hands because of valid policies. To improve this sector, a standard governmental policy should be introduced. AI technology is appropriate for this kind of situation.           |
| Lack of<br><br>IT support      | The ICT support is not widespread in Bangladesh. The IoT based equipment may reduce the production cost. But improved IoT and AI need tremendous IT support.                                                                        |
| Transportation costs           | Advanced vehicles and equipment help the system improve the transportation environment. The correct investments may improve the transportation system, increasing SMEs' business.                                                   |
| Advertisement lacking's        | Another essential part of any successful business strategy is the root level of advertisements and awareness. The advanced algorithm can do the job quickly and enhance the connectivity among SMEs owners and the mass population. |

### 4.7.1 Water management

Using IoT in the water management system can increase the customer's satisfaction and reduce waste. Bangladesh is covered with countless rivers; infect we call our country 'land of rivers'.

Recently the government has taken some steps to improve the condition. Some other uses of IoT in this sector are

- Water leakage detection
- More efficient systemic water management
- Water quality and safety monitoring
- Quality control on water reserves
- Transparency on consumption
- Prescriptive maintenance on infrastructure
- Predict the river erosion
- Advanced water purification

Water management will be a blessing for Bangladesh. Every year numbers of families are destroyed because of river erosion and floods. On the other hand, the ongoing shortage of fresh water in the southern parts of Bangladesh is increasing rapidly. So, proper management in this part will reduce the people's miseries and improve the social balance.

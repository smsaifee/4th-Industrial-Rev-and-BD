### 2.3.2 EDUCATION INDUSTRY

Industrialization and education have a close and vital interaction. This link is seen in the growth of the educational system and research. Educated people are likely to be the ideal audience for fresh ideas. The depth of a society may be gauged by its educational attainment. As a result of the rise of industrialization, educational institutions have also become more domestic. That is why there are so many educational opportunities in the fourth industrial revolution. Education is the only way to close the knowledge gap on the 4th IR, which is still a mystery to most people<sup>[\[40\]](#footnote-40)</sup>.

However, 4th Industrial technologies will also offer up a learning opportunity for everyone. Because of how things are now going with Covid, we can see the value of AI and IoT in education. The frontiers of knowledge are erased by digital educational platforms. We no longer need to go to learn anything since modern technology allows us to access information from anywhere in the globe. Machine learning is also being used in new digital learning systems, which can replicate the human ability to educate. Many countries have already begun teaching their citizens how to use artificial intelligence (AI). In order to increase their student base, online platforms are turning to AI professors. To help authorities plan ahead, an algorithm can anticipate future educational needs and provide recommendations that are both accurate and practical.

### \***\*4.9\*\*** \***\*SURVEILLANCE AND SECURITY\*\***

The security of a nation mostly depends on its capacity in digital equipment. Because the next war is not fought with arms, machines, or algorithms will fight the war. The comprehensive and advanced technological progress allows us to observe and monitor all the activities of mass people. This is the first time in human history we have had the privilege to watch a massive population without reach, anyone. The surveillance equipment is AI-used technology that can monitor a situation and give further recommendations or alerts. Some everyday use of AI in the surveillance field

- - - - Restricted harmful social media activities - Monitoring online activities - Interpret the voice calls - Prevents hate speech, propaganda, insurgency activities

The Bangladeshi government has already started to use various surveillance tools to increase security. Table 4.2 will briefly introduce the current state of the 4th IR in the surveillance and security sector.

**Table 4.10: impact and possibility of 4IR in surveillance and security**

| 4th IR            | Impacts and possibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| AI                | They are using the cc tv camera and analysis of the threats. The AI can detect threats by analyzing millions of data. Security cameras are installed in almost every important place around the country. Extensive data analysis gives a chance to monitor all the public comments and activities on the internet and detect possible threats. |
| IoTand Blockchain | IoT can remotely monitor, and sensors can alarm the authorities about upcoming problems. IoT can also detect possible threats with the help of other IoT devices.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Robotics          | Mainly robotics surveillance is a drone-based surveillance process. Bangladeshi security forces are already using deep machine learning to detect online threats and arrangements. The surveillance with the cc tv footage is also a very promising growth in the security culture of Bangladesh.                                              |

## 5.12 THE CHALLENGE TO MANAGING THE VAST INFORMATION

&nbsp;

4th industrial revolution brings an enormous amount of data to our system. Bangladesh is currently the 10th highest populated country in the world. The amount of data is considerable, and it is a challenge for Bangladeshi authorities to control and surveillance this kind of massive data. On the other hand, we have not prepared the power to handle our data. We are just trading our information for anything. This is going to be a significant threat in the future. If Bangladesh wanted to make sure of its position in the coming new world, there would have to be a complete data management system for all of us. The data management will lead us on the path of privacy maintenance. If the government endure the data management system is a healthy organ used, then our data's privacy may be secure.

## \***\*5.10 BUSINESS CHALLENGES\*\***

The lack of personal experiences in the business scenario in Bangladesh is an emerging problem for the entire Bangladeshi business structure. Our companies are not very aware of the customer's experience model. The product only makes its popularity when the customers give their complete reviews and judgments. Most root-level business companies are not allowed anyone to comment on their products. See, this is a massive gap in the business structure. The challenge only can eradicate by opening more common platforms for reviewing products. First, we have to understand the importance of studying and changing the country's business structure that is entirely study-based. The simplification of the fourth industrial revolution also needs a straightforward business review platform that does not exist in the contemporary business structure of Bangladesh. This is indeed a big challenge for Bangladeshi business culture. If we are not allowed to implicate the customer's experience model and digital reviewing techniques, the rising business sectors may face a stuck position.

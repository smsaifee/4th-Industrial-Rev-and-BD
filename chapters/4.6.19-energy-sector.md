### \***\*4.11\*\*** \***\*ENERGY SECTOR\*\***

The Bangladeshi energy sector has been pool increasing for the last decade. The speed of this transformation needs extra effort and advanced technological support. AI technologies can run an entire power plant and still do not feel any physical challenge. However, the general perception of this energy use is not very promising. The clash between the power sector and human rights climate change is very familiar in our society. Artificial intelligence can make a difference hare advanced machine learning can detect new problems and find possible solutions.

**Table 4.11: Impacts of 4IR in the energy sector**

| 4th IR   | Impacts and possibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| AI       | Big data prediction of possible energy sources. Geological surveys and finding new opportunities. It is sometimes tough to engage mass-level involvement in energy consumed. The algorithm can do this easily by advertisements on social media sites.                                                                 |
| IoT      | The Bangladeshi energy sector is often faced with using inappropriate methods in the mining process. IoT can play a huge role in this sector. By using interconnected machines to enhance the production and at the same time fix the ethical question. However, the economic side of this implication isn't apparent. |
| Robotics | Every energy sector faced a common question of using the unethical approach to the labourer Hare robotics can change the scenario of the energy sector. Using labour robots' energy sectors can diminish the ethical question.                                                                                         |

### 4.7.4 IMPACT ON SMART URBANIZATION

Modern cities around the world are changing the landscape at an incredible speed. Every big city is now connected with data and sensors; these sensors make the environment easier for people.

Digital transportations, free open parking spaces, sensor lights, IoT traffic signals, remote government services, waste management, recycling process, and many advanced monitoring systems are already implicated in the big cities.

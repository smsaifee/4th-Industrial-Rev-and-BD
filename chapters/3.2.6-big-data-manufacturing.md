### 3.2.6 BIG DATA IN MANUFACTURING

Big data means an ample supply of data to the AI system to improve the decision-making capacity of an advanced machine learning system. The core of every machine learning technology is gathering data. Machines learn from the data they have been collected. An industry-only successfully use its AI and ML ability when the system can get enough data. Big Data is defined as colossal data sets, potentially numbering into billions of rows and parameters<sup>[\[27\]](#footnote-27)</sup>. Big data can include data collected at every production stage, including data from machines, devices, and operators. The essential use of big data in the manufacturing industry are-

- Prediction of possible anomalies in the system and suggesting possible solutions.
- Predictive maintenance and quality controls are another important use of big data in the manufacturing industry. The synthesizing of massive data and finding a suitable alternative for maintaining and enhancing the quality is only possible if there is help from AI-based technology**.**
- Determine the tool's life by analyzing previous records. This is because many variables impact how a device will wear over time. Big data analytics can isolate the root cause with greater certainty. Supply chain management and big data are very commonly applicable phenomena. Timing is everything. Big data makes it possible to predict whether or not a supplier will deliver as agreed and makes it possible to optimize supply chains to reduce risk.
- Evaluate the risk factors and identify the following possible solutions. Next, some sectors are identified as extensive data analysis potential future

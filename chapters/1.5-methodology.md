## METHODOLOGY

Various platforms were used to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. As a starting point, I've consulted a wide range of academic and popular sources, including books, articles, and editorials. The papers and data that form the foundation of this project are inseparable. Because there is so little data, the amount of labour required is still limited. After gathering and evaluating the necessary information, the next step was to write it down. Because of the worldwide epidemic, direct surveys have failed. So, the fundamental strategy of this study is to investigate the present situation by comparing it to the data that is already available. It is necessary for me to go over each article's important sections in order to gather qualitative data. They all have flaws that don't fit with the objectives of this piece. 4IR is a very new area of study, with just a small number of studies providing data to support it. Because the subject matter is moving so quickly, data collection has been affected. In contrast, much of the present data and research is adorned with hypotheses. As a result, the structure of this piece follows a logical reasoning model. To begin, the study asked a core question, which remained the same throughout. In order to conduct an in-depth numerical and statistical analysis, the study observed existing data. The following table lays out the research method in a straightforward and concise manner. Observing society and measuring the extensive effects of the fourth industrial revolution on the community were important first steps in the development of this study. The author conducted extensive data analysis to discover patterns and linkages from the public's perspective. Visualizations of plausible hypotheses are then presented, and the writing proceeds in a manner consistent with lending credence to those visualizations. Even though the report doesn't have any real-world evidence, its ideas for how to deal with the fourth industrial hurdle are likely to work.

| Observation<br><br>Visualize ideas | This is the primary part of this research. I observed the impacts and use of the 4th industrial revolution in a society that raised questions about the actual effects of this new industrialization.                                                                                                                                            |
| Data collection (Secondary data)   | The data collection process faced some problems to collect primary data.

| Results                            | After analysing the data and connecting them with the previous hypothesizes, the writing found some gaps. Furthermore, the report also includes some possible solutions for the holes. The research work does not give a concrete theoretical opinion about the problem. But there are many hypothetical explanations included in the writing.   |

**LIMITATIONS**

- The fund was a limitation.
- Another major issue I'll have to deal with in order to finish the thesis is a lack of data. The issue mostly comprises recent aspects of global phenomena, and there isn't much writing on it (mostly from the standpoint of Bangladesh). As a result, searching and sorting through a vast quantity of material and comparing it to Bangladeshi perspectives was a difficult process for me.
- Furthermore, "perceptual gap" developed from this data availability. The majority of the 4IR literature is written by non-social science writers. As a result, there is a significant perception gap. From a Bangladeshi standpoint, there isn't enough room for debate on the subject.
- Also, practically all of the sources are web articles, newspapers, brief write-ups, or just photographs. Because there are few books regarding 4IR, just a handful are used in the literature review. The whole project was qualitative in nature and centered on secondary data. As a result, the quantitative side of the study has certain limitations.
- Because the issue seems to be particularly relevant to the general public, an additional survey may be required. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, we were unable to conduct any further surveys.
- Lack of time is an issue. The COVID crisis had an impact on the academic calendar, which brought the study to a certain limitation.
- Bangladesh, being a growing economy, has a lot of potential in 4IR. However, there aren't expertise to talk about 4IR or gather data. The majority of the information and suggestions are based on international literature.

**STRUCTURE OF THE PAPER:**

In Chapter One, the thesis began with a short introduction of the 4IR, its dimensions, and properties. The report then went on to present the overall picture of 4IR. What are some of the world's issues, and how are they tied to the industrial revolution? After that, the relationship between Bangladesh and 4IR, which was the main point of the thesis, was evaluated in different ways. What are the effects and difficulties of 4IR in Bangladesh, and how are the many areas that are discussed in the chapter changing with the use of 4IR? In addition, the study identifies various gaps and issues, as well as potential solutions (short-term, mid-term, and long-term). Finally, the paper concluded with a recommendation and a suggestion for additional study on the subject. The concept will undoubtedly inspire fresh methods of thinking and pique the attention of scholars in the case.

## THE CHALLENGES

Like any other revolution, this one will have to deal with political, economic, organizational, and social problems. Automated data sharing is the newest revolution, bringing enhanced human-machine interfaces with real-time communication. Add big data and digital processing platforms to this speed for more operator transparency. The operator will figure out what the overall task is, figure out how to do it best, and give the systems parts the freedom to monitor themselves. This gives machines a lot of flexibility because they can predict how they will break down and fix them or plan maintenance before they happen. Companies will save a lot of money because there will be less downtime, overall efficiency will go up, and the number of workers will continue to go down. But people will be wary and worried about losing their jobs. In the history of the industrial revolution, every time there was a project to make jobs easier, some jobs were lost. Innovation, on the other hand, would lead to new jobs that require different skills, so people would have to retrain. This chapter talks about the difficulties of 4IR from a social and economic point of view in Bangladesh. We do know that not all societies are the same and that each one has its own morals and values. Bangladeshis are just like anyone else. Bangladeshi culture and ideas also sometimes have trouble adapting to a new trend. So, it is very important that we figure out what the problems are and where the gaps are. This will give us a fair and clear picture of what to do and what not to do.

## ARE WE PREPARED?

An important conclusion of this study is the identification of a few "Gaps," which are the most significant. Connecting tools between the future of fourth-generation industrialization and Bangladeshi society are provided by these technologies. A high-profile technological shift is not something that the country's present social or economic framework is equipped for. Bangladesh's socio-economic structure may, nevertheless, be compatible with this revolution's future. A concrete structure should be followed for at least 10 years and substantial structural advances should be made. New ideas and chances for technological advancements will be generated as a result of these structural changes. Meanwhile, the government should keep working to perfect the next phase of industrialization. Bangladesh, on the other hand, does not have a lot of time to overhaul the whole system. Yet it also demonstrated that as a design evolves, so does society's ability to accommodate new developments. The next section of the article explains some of the important Gaps in Bangladesh's fourth industrial revolution. These disparities are not new; they have been a part of our socioeconomic system for a long time. The present state of Bangladesh's industrialization is mostly due to these shortcomings. Compared to other wealthy nations, these disparities may derail our hopes for considerable success in the next industrial revolution. Bangladesh's social structure and endemic difficulties have made it difficult for the country to maintain international standards in all of its industrial sectors. There are numerous discrepancies between what we want and what is really happening. Even if the globe has already entered a new era of transition, problems such as corruption and civil discontent persist.

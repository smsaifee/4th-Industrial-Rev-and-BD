Environment problems are like silent killers. They do not appear in concrete structures until its too big. 4th IR has also had environmental challenges in the Bangladeshi context. The negative aftermath of climate change turned Bangladesh into a challenging place to implicate new technology. The core elements of 4IR need massive cooperation and recognition, but the environments sometimes do not give us the privilege of enjoying a suitable position.

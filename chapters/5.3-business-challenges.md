## 5.3 CHALLENGE IN THE BUSINESS FIELD

Some fundamental challenges are constantly impacting the Bangladeshi business community. However, the 4IR eradicates many challenges like transportation advertisements. But there are still some challenges in the business fields in Bangladesh, such as

- The paucity of governmental support to the new business institutions
- Most business institutions do not have enough statistical knowledge, and they often fail to predict upcoming business failures.
- Lack of instrumental support is another big challenge for the Bangladeshi business structure. Most of the industry in Bangladesh uses century-old machinery that is not appropriate for recent developing technologies.
- The working environment of Bangladesh is not standard. Often, we face upheavals from workers, which is a massive challenge for Bangladeshi industries.
- Lack of research in the business field drives us to an uncertain business condition. Research increases the ability of a creating sector, and the rudimentary sector of Bangladesh's business model is garments, yet we do not have enough research in this sector, which is portrayed in recent turmoils in the garments industry. Policymakers find themselves in a dark place regarding those problems.

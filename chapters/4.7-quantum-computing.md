## \***\*4.14 Quantum computing and its impacts on the Bangladeshi context\*\***

Computing using quantum computers makes use of quantum phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference that can't be replicated with classical computers. This is a departure from the more standard approaches to programming. The term "cloud computing" refers to the delivery of a variety of services through the Internet. Data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software are examples of these resources. Data and software applications may be accessed by any electronic device with an internet connection. There is still a lot of confusion and inconsistency in Bangladeshi policy on each of these issues. In spite of this, the government has a curriculum for AI, IoT, and Robotics in place. However, cloud computing and quantum computing are the most important aspects of these technologies. The nation is missing, Hare. For sophisticated computer models, the country's core infrastructure does not meet requirements. This is mostly due to an absence of education, lack of government backing, corruption, a dearth of private investment, and a lack of public awareness. A few initiatives have been implemented by the government, such as constructing ICT parks and training and education in the field of information technology.

| Fields                                  | Impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Chemical and biological and Engineering | The quantum computing field isn't ready to take over Bangladesh's physical and natural areas. Still, there is enough scope to discover new pathways and create a future environment for improvements.       |
| Cyber security                          | Bangladeshi society is now facing primary level cyber security threats in social media. Still, there is a big chance that the dangers may shift to another dimension and create new problems in the future. |
| Manufacturing and 3D printing           | Although, Bangladesh hasn't failed; low-grade 3D printing factories already produce local stuff like toys and plastic necessities.                                                                          |

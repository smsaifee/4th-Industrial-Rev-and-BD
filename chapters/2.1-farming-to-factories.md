## 2.1 FARMING TO FACTORIES

In the days of collective dominance, our brains and actions were progressing in a secretive way. In the history of human civilization, our lives have been easier and more accessible than ever before. We were able to overcome every strange situation, so the problems seemed extremely normal to us. Discovering fire sparked the first flame of progress in human history. Nuclear power has been around for thousands of years, yet we today rely on it to meet our demands. As a result of the industrial revolution, civilization has seen extraordinary growth during the last two centuries. With the creation of the steam engine in Europe, humankind's journey went off at a breakneck pace and smashed through every barrier in its path. Astonishingly, the industrial revolution was able to swiftly adapt to new developments in society. There are moments when recent developments might be difficult to accept, but our community works hard to keep them under control. A whole new issue confronted the Industrial Revolution after 200 years of steady advancement. Change is being wrought by the most recent innovations and the people who employ them. Some of these alterations even call into question the need for human participation in certain industries. To make our lives easier, we built the machines. But today, the machines are finding their own ease. Developing technologies such as artificial intelligence and deep machine learning bring up new possibilities. It is possible for devices to talk directly with one another and make choices on their own. However, these are only samples of basic machine learning, and the true challenges lie at their core. As the scope of the new world grows, so does the need for robots to have greater power at their disposal. As a result of these developments, the scope of the fourth industrial revolution may be expanded. However, the issue is how we can handle this sophisticated technology without jeopardizing human survival. The issue has previously been asked in every imaginable field, and no one knows the answer.

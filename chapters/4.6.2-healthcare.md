### \***\*4.6.2\*\*** \***\*HEALTHCARE\*\***

In healthcare, AI could be a game-changer for all of us. The current healthcare system in Bangladesh is struggling with human resources problems. The ratio of doctor and patient is not satisfying; for every 10000 people, there are only six doctors in Bangladesh. On the other hand, the total medical college in Bangladesh is not fulfilling the demands. The administrative process of the medical scenario is also horrific. Millions of medical equipment are left untouched and unused because there is no sufficient workforce to operate this equipment. There are numerous possibilities to use AI, IoT, Robotics in this sector and develop the current healthcare scenario. The covid crisis shows some real drawbacks of the Bangladeshi health care system. In one way, this is an eye-opener for all of us to think and act differently. The following table shows the impacts of the 4th IR in the healthcare sector in Bangladesh.

| Robotics | This particular sector has an immense field to improve medical conditions. Already the robotics operations are performing in the hospitals. Still, the numbers aren't very high, but there are possibilities that this field could expand in future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IoT      | IoT is used in laboratories. The advanced instruments detect the problems meticulously. Advanced CT scan, X-ray, ECG, EEG and various blood tests are performed by advanced IoT based machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| AI       | Algorithms are all over the medical sector in Bangladesh. From doctor's appointments to advanced medical research AI played the filtering role. Extensive data analysis can also improve the condition of the current medical system. AI can predict possible medical emergencies by analyzing numerous public medical data. The recent covid 19 vaccination program shows the real power of the algorithm. Bangladesh's massive challenge is to continue the program without AI support. As of February 2022, the Bangladeshi government vaccinated nearly 75% of total population<sup>[\[58\]](#footnote-58)</sup> .Without the support of AI and extensive data analysis, it is almost impossible to handle this kind of mass program. |

## \***\*5.11 SOCIAL CHALLENGES\*\***

Bangladeshi society is very complex. The country has more than 163 million people in just 56 thousand square miles. These indicate a vast cultural gap inside the country. So, what happens if these peoples face a new dynamic change in their society? They indeed react haphazardly because the Bangladeshi social structure is not ready for this massive change in the community in this regard, I have found some social challenges that created a significant gap in society. These challenges are the reason for not completing our dream of achieving success in the 4<sup>th</sup> IR.

| Social underclass  | The last two centuries of human society have produced unprecedented technologies, but we still need civil society independent from government and companies to keep our Industrial Revolutions "human-cantered. Bangladeshi culture is now facing the problem of dividing populations into two parts. A new group of the underclass is raising quietly in the Bangladeshi community. The lack of economic support and the difference between rich risings is rising, directly affecting the fourth industrial sectors. People are not sure about the changes, and the lack of knowledge derived them into the path of ignorance of judgment.                                                                                                                                             |
| Ethical            | The multiplication of the Fourth Industrial Revolution innovations, for example, the Internet of Things, 3D printing, and genetic altering, expands on signs of progress in advanced and AI capacities, the dangers and effects of information assurance, algorithmic inclination, separation, and separation protection are dramatically expanded. Computerized risks will take on more prominent actual results, extending existing disparity and segregation in manners that would be almost difficult to follow or comprehend in human limits. Bangladeshi social structure is already facing ethical questions on numerous topics. Where this new technological ethics is will stand in this scenario? The challenge of ethical clearance is a big issue in the implication sector. |
| Propaganda         | Another side of the Bangladeshi social structure is that propaganda significantly affects social measurement, and people love to believe biased news. One common thinking about the internet and advanced tech is that these are the reason behind the social unrest. But we have to understand that we can't avoid the technologies. We have to live with the machines and algorithms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Social instability | Bangladeshi social stability is very much dependent on political strength and religious unity. The recent Bangladeshi society faces some new ideological clashes between the government and society. The government's decision of digitalisation often mocks religious extremists and political anarchists. They portray the digitalisation process as a negative phenomenon, a significant problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Engagements        | As the previous point suggested, the presentation of digital development is not very charming in Bangladeshi society; there is a significant gap in the engagements issue. Ordinary people do not feel comfortable engaging in new technologies. The mind-set of ordinary people about new technology is all negative. This is a big challenge for us to create a new ideology about the fourth industrial revolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Transparency       | Developing countries have some endemic problems like transparency in their social structure. Bangladesh is not out of this equation. Bangladesh is currently holding 13th position in the global transparency ranking. 4th IR needs clarity and commitment, which is not present in a corrupt system. Though the Bangladeshi government is trying their heart and soul to reduce the problem, our population and diversity do not allow us to take a cantered judgment. The challenge of being clear and transparent in the advancement process is hugely important for all kinds of revolution.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

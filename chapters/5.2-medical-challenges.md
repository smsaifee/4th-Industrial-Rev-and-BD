## 5.2 IN THE MEDICAL AREA, THERE IS A PROBLEM

The fundamental problem in this sector is a dearth of knowledge in the United States. Despite the fact that we have a big number of medical professionals, the population of Bangladesh does not support this level of care. As a result, the challenge is quantitatively deficient, therefore. Just for the sake of keeping track of things. Many of today's most cutting-edge 4IR equipment is difficult to use due to their complexity. The outcome is a slew of issues for most public health care facilities. They don't have the staff to run these devices, and even if they had, the person running them may not have enough time to do so since he or she will be committing to another private institution. As a result, Bangladesh's medical infrastructure is a far cry from what we're used to.

### 2.3.5 THE FIELD OF ENERGY

Customized energy experiences for consumers, prosumers, and service providers are essential to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Energy decisions made by consumers and prosumers need to be clearly communicated to them so that they can take responsibility for their actions. The specific manner in which energy is transformed, supplied, produced, and distributed is essential. The usage of non-renewable energy is expanding at an alarming rate, and we need to lessen our reliance on these industries. We may expect that a new wave of clean energy will be introduced over the world with the help of sophisticated technology and the integration of the 4th IR and machine. AI and machine learning will also help to cut energy costs, which is a significant development. A rise in industrialization can be expected as a result of the availability of cheap energy. Advanced economies have begun the transition to clean, green energy generation, and emerging nations are following suit.

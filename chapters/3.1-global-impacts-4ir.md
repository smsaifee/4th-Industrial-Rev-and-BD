## 3.1 THE GLOBAL IMPACTS OF THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

We can't even begin to imagine the ramifications of a fourth industrial revolution that goes beyond our wildest dreams. Obtaining a beach signifies a rise in business, economy, and society, as well as the rise of people in Bangladesh. All of heaven's bounty, on the other hand, is not permitted to serve humanity. Unfortunately, this 4IR has some downsides, which we must address head on. Meeting the problems is essential if we are to benefit from contemporary marvels; nevertheless, if we do not address the issues, our existing socioeconomic, political, or social standing may be diminished. This portion of the writing focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of 4IR. This chapter's challenges, and how we could solve them, are explained in detail in this chapter's Problems section. New industries and huge productivity are examined in the next section. To show the effects, I've divided the worldwide implications into three main categories.

- Mainstream manufacturing industries
- IT and Job industries
- Other sectors, including SMEs

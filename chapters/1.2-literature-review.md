## LITERATURE REVIEW

A literature review is similar to collecting past thinkers' possibilities. We can better understand a topic by following their lead and sharing our expertise. In a literature review, the last options and aspirations of a writer are carried out with the opinions of others. I used some earlier research and writing on the industrial revolution to complete and embellish this piece. Because this work tries to uncover gaps and answers from a Bangladeshi viewpoint, I prioritize Bangladesh context writing. Even though I have not seen many earlier reports on the subject, it is still a novel issue for most thinkers.

So, to better understand 4IR, I read a variety of articles, books, journals, newspaper editorials, conference papers, and other literature connected to my research. The global perspective of the 4th IR gives a sense of the problem as a whole, and relating that idea to current literature helped me see the whole picture.

In his book, Yuval Noah Harari (2018), he discussed a new world of technological growth. The next industrial revolution's prospects and countless applications in our society are described in detail through a comprehensive review of human history. The book explores how human civilization is falling into the hands of algorithms and how our needs are artificially fulfilled. Another focus of the book is the difficulties of the twenty-first century and how they connect to the emerging advanced world. Bangladesh is part of the near future of human civilization since we are at the forefront of this progress. Most crucially, the book is about forthcoming events that have the potential to alter the course of human history. The book also examines the contemporary educational landscape and the societal effects of post-truth. The natural consequences of 4IR on the planet are also linked to the global underclass and future concerns. The book also has several flaws, such as the fact that it does not provide any actual scenario from a global viewpoint. Furthermore, the book raised concerns about the present social order, religious practices, and social standards, but the criticisms were not adequately explained. On the other hand, the book simply portrays the looming uncertainty, but it does not adequately depict the possibility of our incredible recovery.

Klaus Schwab's seminal book "The Fourth Industrial Revolution," published in 2016, revolutionized how people and rechargers thought about 4IR. In his book, Klaus explains the reasoning behind 4IR and how this transition will occur in our society. What will we do if we have to deal with life changes? A framework is created when people are more aware of the 4IR. The book's three main goals are to provide a platform for everyone to recognize issues and overcome hurdles. He stresses the 4IR drivers. Most significantly, the influence of these factors on our society is clearly explored. Women's empowerment, the 4IR ethical standard, remapping the business market, the digital economy, risks, and opportunities are all examples of his writing. Our survival is always contingent on our moral choices, and he posed a fundamental issue about eroding our moral basis in the face of unparalleled progress. Because this is the first substantial explanation and constructive guidelines for 4IR, the book is like a bible. The book avoids societal structural disruptions such as unexpected economic crises, wars, and pandemics and does not explain the ramifications. The facts in the book can be used to explain how social situations run smoothly. To put it another way, the reader avoids making a reasonable presumption about the subject. The data and theories do not appear to be concrete for every civilization since the industrial process is not fully active in every society. Though the author acknowledged the flaws, we must remember that this is the first effort in this field. The book omitted the section on recommendations, although the rationale is more technical than human. The author was prompted to summarize the topic in the global context due to a lack of field surveys and data from a third-world nation.

Md. Joynal Abdin (2019) discussed the 4IR and Bangladesh's industrialization reality. He concentrated on Bangladesh's primary and secondary income sectors and how they connect to the fourth industrial revolution. He also underlines the need to expand the capability of SMEs. What role might these industries play in the future? He paves the way for future research by identifying the 4IR targeted industries. His writings include topics such as medicine, human resource export, outsourcing, and agriculture-processing. The essay falls short of defining the social and cultural context of 4IR in Bangladesh, which is critical to fully comprehending the situation. A detailed understanding of the social structure and public demand of this new revolution is required to investigate future areas of development.

An essay by Abdus Shabnur and Monowar Wadud Hridoy (2021) looked into the problems of involving industry 4.0 in Bangladesh. They discovered some basic issues or explanations for the delay and proposed solutions. Weak infrastructures, a lack of understanding, a weak transit system, natural calamities, and officials' unwillingness are some of the main conclusions drawn from the paper. They also stress the need to strengthen the knowledge component. The 4IR may be accomplished rapidly by educating the populace. The major objective should be to educate and train individuals to recognize problems and respond quickly. Any country benefits from having skilled people. The study, however, covers a variety of sectors and consequences of 4IR in Bangladesh, but it fails to pinpoint the gaps between present and recognized circumstances.

In the article fourth industrial revolution in Bangladesh: Prospects and challenges (2020), writers emphasize sustainable ICT development, increasing productivity, and women and citizen empowerment. They also identify five significant sectors of interest to describe the possible future scenario industrial revolution in Bangladesh. These sectors mainly described the education system, risk of automation, security concerns of 4IR. The future investment sectors in Bangladesh are also described in the article, and they emphasize alternative employment training for substantial human resources. The vast population of Bangladesh is ideal for making a considerable amount of skilled labor.

Furthermore, they describe some other possibilities of data security and governance. The article fully emphasizes the importance of ICT-based education and its implications, but there is a knowledge gap in this issue. The article does not fully represent the gaps or challenges behind the potential successful future.

In an article paper, Wasabi bin Latif, Dr. Khurshida Pervin, and M. Karim (2021) presented higher education as a problematic but thrilling possibility in the fourth industrial revolution. This essay emphasizes the necessity of a competent, educated population and the form of Bangladesh's future education landscape. They demonstrate that Bangladeshi education is trapped in the second industrial revolution. The whole system is based on an outdated approach that is no longer relevant in the current era. The fourth industrial revolution components include critical thinking, people management, and emotional intelligence. However, the recent social upheaval, unemployment, and a lack of ambition to establish a new school system do not provide adequate opportunity. Finally, the essay offered several suggestions for improving the situation. Nonetheless, the paper avoids discussing the implications of educational reforms on how society might address contemporary issues. Furthermore, the report did not indicate how the general public might learn about the new adjustments.

The fourth industrial revolution in a poor nation was the subject of an essay published in 2018 in "The Journal of Management Information and Decision Science," with Bangladesh as the case study. The authors of the study discussed the problems that Bangladesh has in achieving the 4IR. Bangladesh's key obstacles are a lack of infrastructure, the availability of cheaper labor, the high cost of technology installation, a lack of government assistance, and a lack of education. A crucial obstacle that stymies the process is the disconnect between authority and labor. The Industrial Revolution required people to learn more about RMG, leather, shipbuilding, and agriculture. The proposal for success in 4IR is based on long-term development, risk minimization, human reliance reduction, financial security, overcoming structural problems, and boosting production efficiency. The article contains limitations in terms of detailing the connectivity path, such as how certain issues are solved. On the other hand, the report lists the problems but doesn't show how they relate to the different parts of society.

According to Atiqul Islam Chowdhury, cloud connections between people and cyber-physical systems have been made easier (2021). He saw four critical areas where this business might succeed. Cloud computing's importance in Bangladesh cannot be emphasized enough. According to him, some of the standard focus variables for improving the situation include total automation, cost-effective business, workplace security, enormous scientific approach, remote diagnostics, cancer prediction, and healthcare data analysis. Digital payment, loan risk management systems, AI instructors, and automated grading systems in the financial and education sectors will help Bangladesh become a Digital Bangladesh. Bangladesh's hopes of becoming a worldwide role model are dependent on this technological progress. However, the essay gives some recommendations for establishing the optimal 4IR environment. Still, the study didn't talk about how the public feels about this significant change in how society thinks about this issue.

Research on RMG was published in the International Journal of Social, Political, and Economic Research regarding the potential trade-off in Bangladesh during the fourth industrial revolution (2018). The article's main focus is on the relevance of minor RMGs and how they are affected by automated shutdowns. Technological advancement improves productivity while also creating a jobless society that is not beneficial to Bangladeshis. The authors discover a basic cause behind the issue. Poor infrastructural development, untrained staff, high costs of implementing new technology, and a lack of technological understanding are the key obstacles preventing Bangladesh from benefiting from 4IR. Finally, the paper suggests increasing government funding for a research institution, a social safety program, trained personnel, SME sector assistance, and automation industry identification. Because the article solely outlines the RMG sector, the study lacks ground-level research. What about the people and businesses who rely on this RMG?

Shah Md Azimul Ehsan (2021) focuses on the future of Bangladesh's job economy and the impact of artificial intelligence. By making people's lives more straightforward, AI will increase job security, productivity, and compensation. However, the article raises concerns regarding AI's application in the RMG industry. Bangladesh is still missing in this sector, whereas other countries utilize AI in every available field. Another component of the research is the prospect of producing new jobs. He claims that the earlier industrial revolution had similar issues and that our civilization handled them admirably. In addition, the 4IR creates a unique work sector and meets people's needs. Because fear of automation is expected, the best course of action is to limit the dangers and maximize opportunities. RMG industries are undergoing a new wave of modernization, with nations like China and Vietnam expanding their capabilities. Bangladesh will face a new challenge if it uses AI to boost the RMG industry because the RMG sector still uses technology from the third industrial revolution. The social structural deficiencies are not highlighted in the article. These discrepancies are the critical roadblocks to RMG sector reform and 4IR implementation.

In Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari (2015) illustrates the difficulties of the current industrial revolution. The surveillance capitalism era and the impending industrial revolution are intertwined. Machines are now ready to take command of human cognitive functions. Although humans invented these devices, they are integral to our everyday lives. The majority of the time, we fail to operate these machines properly. The paradox of knowledge complicates the situation further. Another essential book finding is the impending era of data dominance and control over data. The impact of massive data analysis on our overall social and economic situation and how these impacts relate to the fourth industrial revolution. The book also discusses the problems of the new humanism approach and the current roadblocks. However, the book is hypothesis-based, with several predictions demonstrated.

Nevertheless, the dynamic social structure is more complex and unique. The book itself has a core question of whether we are appropriate to judge the books. Because we believe the book by our standard and another part of our society is machines and how these are related to the book's findings is impossible to identify. Also, the data of this book has some limitations of covering the minimal field.

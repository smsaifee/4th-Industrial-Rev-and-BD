### 2.3.4 INDUSTRY OF HEALTH CARE

Artificial intelligence (AI) has had a considerable impact on the current healthcare system, particularly in the area of health. AI and machine learning algorithms have completely transformed the field of medicine. The discovery of drugs, personalized therapies, genome sequencing, patient monitoring, and vaccines is increasingly commonplace in medical science. In order to maximize the chances of a successful operation, robotics is increasingly often employed. Medical treatment is heavily reliant on human-machine cooperation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) now plays a significant role in even the educational aspects of any medical department. Both patients and medical personnel are benefiting from the advancements in communication technology. We are able to immediately connect with doctors throughout the world since we have direct access to them. We must make certain that we have the necessary equipment. They're ground-breaking, to say the least. Illnesses are now under control and many life-threatening diseases have already been eliminated over the world. We are also living longer lives than ever before, and we are now in a position where we can take control of our own misery.

## 5.14 CHALLENGE IN CONTROLLING SOCIAL MEDIA IN BANGLADESH

Currently, the total number of social media users in Bangladesh is 22million. There is a considerable number, but there is much uncertainty regarding this issue. Social media has a vast field of data sharing and communication. This is all about the prime implication of advanced machine learning. Bangladeshi culture is not familiar with this kind of colossal change. So, there is a chance that we may miss the opportunity of connecting people and using this platform for our hideous perspectives. Recent data and activities also support this. Social media baseness is growing so fast in our society that the situation may go out of control in the future.

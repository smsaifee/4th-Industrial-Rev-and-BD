**4.18 INDIVIDUAL'S IMPACTS OF THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN BANGLADESH**

The essential component of any industrialization is humans. Automation always aims to empower humans and increase human society's total living conditions. From the very first industrialization, every improvement is followed human superiority and connection how the new changes evolved culture and make an easy lifestyle for human society is what revolution wants. The land of 163 million people isn't an easy place to match everyone's demands and fulfill their expectations. The course also needs sacrifice, which could be a base for subsequent improvements. So, what is special about this 4th IR is that it can eradicate individual interest? The answer is straightforward this revolution wants our cognitive ability and mimic our actions. Bangladesh is a labor-intensive developing country. The impacts of the 4th IR heavily attacked our ability and opportunity. The actual consequences depend on who and where these technologies are implanted. It is not possible that everyone is satisfied with the new changes; it is widespread that everyone has their ideology or opinions. However, we do not have enough time or chance to give our ideas. The speed of new machine learning technology is higher than we ever predicted. The following table explains some of the individual impacts of the 4th IR in Bangladesh.

**Table 4.17: Individuals impacts of 4th industrial revolution in Bangladesh**

| Issues                          | Impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Polarised individual behaviours | The use of social media powered by algorithms and machine learning reduced the social correlations and existence. Most individuals use the internet as a communication tool, not an explanative medium. |
| Decrease In personal choice     | Artificial Intelligence also made a hypocritical society entirely found only in our devices made a romantic reality. Personal choices are monitored and also advised by algorithms.                     |
| Lack of<br><br>human connection | Direct interactions between people are decreasing, and online interactions are now a popular choice for most users. They don't want to disconnect from their devices.                                   |
| Privacy                         | Individuals' private life is facing a clash with utopian online-based social structure. The amount of privacy of individuals is decreasing.                                                             |

# The challenges

Like any other revolution, this one will have to deal with political, economic, organizational, and social problems. Automated data sharing is the newest revolution, bringing enhanced human-machine interfaces with real-time communication. Add big data and digital processing platforms to this speed for more operator transparency. The operator will figure out what the overall task is, figure out how to do it best, and give the systems parts the freedom to monitor themselves. This gives machines a lot of flexibility because they can predict how they will break down and fix them or plan maintenance before they happen. Companies will save a lot of money because there will be less downtime, overall efficiency will go up, and the number of workers will continue to go down. But people will be wary and worried about losing their jobs. In the history of the industrial revolution, every time there was a project to make jobs easier, some jobs were lost. Innovation, on the other hand, would lead to new jobs that require different skills, so people would have to retrain. This chapter talks about the difficulties of 4IR from a social and economic point of view in Bangladesh. We do know that not all societies are the same and that each one has its own morals and values. Bangladeshis are just like anyone else. Bangladeshi culture and ideas also sometimes have trouble adapting to a new trend. So, it is very important that we figure out what the problems are and where the gaps are. This will give us a fair and clear picture of what to do and what not to do.

**ARE WE PREPARED?**

An important conclusion of this study is the identification of a few "Gaps," which are the most significant. Connecting tools between the future of fourth-generation industrialization and Bangladeshi society are provided by these technologies. A high-profile technological shift is not something that the country's present social or economic framework is equipped for. Bangladesh's socio-economic structure may, nevertheless, be compatible with this revolution's future. A concrete structure should be followed for at least 10 years and substantial structural advances should be made. New ideas and chances for technological advancements will be generated as a result of these structural changes. Meanwhile, the government should keep working to perfect the next phase of industrialization. Bangladesh, on the other hand, does not have a lot of time to overhaul the whole system. Yet it also demonstrated that as a design evolves, so does society's ability to accommodate new developments. The next section of the article explains some of the important Gaps in Bangladesh's fourth industrial revolution. These disparities are not new; they have been a part of our socioeconomic system for a long time. The present state of Bangladesh's industrialization is mostly due to these shortcomings. Compared to other wealthy nations, these disparities may derail our hopes for considerable success in the next industrial revolution. Bangladesh's social structure and endemic difficulties have made it difficult for the country to maintain international standards in all of its industrial sectors. There are numerous discrepancies between what we want and what is really happening. Even if the globe has already entered a new era of transition, problems such as corruption and civil discontent persist.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

There has always been a way out of any problem. Bangladesh can overcome the challenges of the 4th industrial revolution, and we can go even further and make a unique place for ourselves in this industrial revolution. We have a large population, people willing to work hard, and a government willing to work. What we need are just good rules and connections between people. Our great liberation war was a perfect test of national unity and a way to make terms that seemed impossible possible. So now, in this technologically advanced war, we have to be ready for any trouble. On the other hand, the government has started many projects to get more people involved in the 4th industrial revolution. We are already running out of time in the future of AI war. We need to think of some new and effective ways to improve our position in this situation.

**BUILD A BASE FOR REVOLUTION AND OVERCOME**

**THE DEPENDENCY OF PREVIOUS INDUSTRIAL ELEMENTS**

- Joint collaboration with develop world
- New treaty on 4IR
- Worker's exchange
- Mass production
- Skill developments
- Infrastructure revolution
- Structural development forms the very root level
- Engage more rural community
- Utilize the resources

The most important aspect of overcoming the challenges is connectivity with other countries. the 4IR is the basis of all kinds of connectivity. In this globalized world, we need more connections which ultimately develop our chances to improve our condition. The corporative moves increase the opportunity to further investment and joint production of various technical products. after the collaborative show, we need more training and exchange a massive number of workers with the developing world. Furthermore, we need to build a solid structural development base for the revolution. The most challenging aspect of applying industry 4.0 technologies is security and risk issues. This online integration will provide room for security breaches and data leaks. There are issues with internet hacking. As a result, critical security problems are exacerbated by the data interconnectedness and weak digital infrastructure. Moreover, the country's poor infrastructure, such as poor road and transportation, more prone to natural disasters, technological device markets, and productions are still creating the barriers for the Bangladeshi key planners to think regarding industry 4.0. Besides, the introduction of industry 4.0 technologies requires more investment and research in several areas, such as Internet broadband disbursement, IT security, cybersecurity, and cyber lay. It will affect education as a new industry that requires new skills.

**FURTHER AREARS THAT NEED A MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT**

**National committee/ Institution for 4IR**

It has become essential that Bangladesh needs an individual institution and research center to develop the entire 4IR perspective. The proposal may seem extraordinarily naive. However, the usefulness of this action will surely improve the future path. The importance of an institution is not the institution itself. It's more than a material thing; it's all about the support. When the government built a particular institution about 4IR, the people started to realize the importance of the event. For example, when the government opened an individual ministry in the bridge department, we realized the importance of bridges. The government also found an easy pathway to invest in the sector. We have an ICT ministry, but the grapes of 4IR are beyond our imagination, and they are related to ICT and all the mundane sectors. Even politics is associated with this global change.

**Eradicate the 'GAP' in communication**

We all have ideas and dreams about our future, prospects, and work. So, the technological development of Bangladesh has started to create a generation of loneliness combined with tremendous opportunity. Any five-year-old kid in Bangladesh can make a robot, program a beautiful game, or make an attractive application. However, the problems rely on another field. A Bangladeshi kid may make an AI robot in the future, but it is not certain that the kid will receive any proper support. These ideas vanish into the dust just because these kids don't know where to go with these robots. From a Bangladeshi perspective, the connection between authority and the local mind is like light-years. Governments and society need to close these gaps and accept all the ideas and efforts that lead us to a better future.

**Education sector**

The current educational system of Bangladesh is very complex. Bangladesh's government has come up with a standard effective curriculum for all students. Furthermore, they must expand the vocational study sector and encourage young students to pursue technical studies.The examination system should also be redefined and public examinations reduced. In the higher education sector, the implications of technological research should be improved. The number of technical schools has to be increased. Also, educational skill development programs are essential to reach a more expansive community. This skill development sector of Bangladesh is still facing some significant problems, like a low percentage of participation in the development program. The responsibility of engaging more community is that development depends on government and is related to our social and educational organizations. Furthermore, there are some basic recommendations for improving the education scenario are -

- Increase the digital classroom around the country.
- Ensuring the contributions of the students in those classrooms.
- Organize training programs for teachers and officials to adopt new technologies.
- Enlightened the parents about the correct use of digital platforms
- Massive student training program to increase the technical knowledge
- Ensure vast education research on this topic
- A complete government guideline for using 4IR in the academic sector.

**Business sector**

Newly growing economic situations are demanding new challenges. Entrepreneurship is not very much familiar from the Bangladeshi business perspective. So, there is a big chance to create new fields in the entrepreneurship sector and use the 4th IR as a primary tool for development. The 4th IR components need fewer startups' conditions and investments.

This phenomenon is a massive opportunity for all upraising fields to engage more in this business model. The availability of the internet and the spreading network indeed threaten the development, and the business field of Bangladesh faces new dimensions. Some more steps may increase the stuck situation in the business model, such as

- Increase the human capital and encourages them to invest in the new business sectors
- Increase the governmental loans for the startups
- Decrease the equipment's prices so that majority of the people can be engaged in this massive development project
- Organize more business fears and give everyone a chance to share their ideas. See, the 4IR is a sharing platform for increasing the productivity
- Encourage the local investors
- Priories the new inventions and create a pathway for them to connect directly with authority.

**Manufacturing and Import-Export**

One precondition for achieving full functional 4th IR is an updated manufacturing process. Bangladeshi industries have to increase their production by using new technological instruments in the manufacturing fields. The garments industry is considered one of the prominent sectors of the Bangladeshi economy, so engaging advanced technologies should start to form the most potential sector. The Bangladeshi government has already reduced the tax related to ICT sectors business equipment, which is an indicator of government support. What society need is to use the opportunity.

**Environment-friendly cooperation**

We need to take some steps to make sure that we are approaching a position of collective measurements that can save our environment and improve our 4th IR capacity. Few progressive steps can be applied in the Bangladeshi scenario to achieve the required success

- Increase the idea of the green factory around the country
- Mandatory survey to find out industrial gaps that may create a situation of extreme environmental hazards
- National curriculum for new coming 4th IR based industries
- Sufficient training for the employees that they can understand the depth of the situation
- More research in the innovation field so that we can find the possible solution of managing carbon emission and at the same time improve our technological marathon.

**Agricultural development**

For a developed agriculture scenario in the future world, we need some creative measurements that make an advanced position for the future challenges. Some recommended steps are

&nbsp;

- Increasing the training facilities around the country, especially the remote regions, do need the maximum support
- Increases the use of organic cultivation with the help of AI
- Examine the wester forecast with the help of artificial intelligence and alarm about the harvesting seasons calamities like sudden flood (mainly in the eastern part of the country)
- Using the internet so that the depth and accountability will grow spontaneously
- Government initiatives for making more institutions that can increase the 4th IR field

**Research and innovation**

Whether social and political or economic research, any improvement process is essential for all these developments. Bangladesh is already lacking in the research sector, and the fourth industrial revolution is quite a new phenomenon for Bangladesh, so there is a gap in the research sector. To improve the condition government should provide more funding in the research sectors and emphasize the new ideas. On the other hand, universities and independent organizations must join this sector and provide essential support. The more we dig the 4th IR, the less we face new problems.

**Qualitative development**

The network speed of Bangladeshi internet is not up to the mark, k and this situation have to change quickly mass community still have not enjoyed top-notch internet connection-a Majority of Bangladeshi freelancers and business companies has colossal question marks on the internet speed issue. The quality of the internet has not followed the total coverage of the internet quantitively, development has no real impact on the 4th IR where, whereas qualitative development ensures the success of any regulations.

**Easy entry**

The fundamental problem of any Bangladeshi business model is entering the marketplace. Because of some real business giants, The Bangladeshi business structure has not succeeded in the independent individual models. 4thIR has finally bought consumers and providers on the same platforms. Nevertheless, there is a considerable gap or challenges in this entering period. Because of a lack of previous experience, most of the newcomer companies of Bangladesh suffered. To avoid this kind of situation we have to be more reliable in the newcomer's business. The entry-level companies also need

- Moral support from the society
- Easy loan policies
- Government sponsors projects which may give engendering support.
- Easy advertisements

**Easy access to the technologies**

The developed countries had a behavior of colonial exploitation in their system. Most developing countries faced a common problem of not finding easy entry into new technologies. They are almost dependent on developing countries for technical stuff and training. The easy access in this sector may increase the number of new industrial scenarios in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi industries are almost dependent on developed countries for the latest technological investment. Government should open new industrial fields just for the technical materials and emphasize to the new companies that they can expand their business.

**Social stability**

Another essential criterion of improving any industrialization is making a solid social structure. Bangladesh has a history of social bonding and sharing sorrow. Our great liberation war is a vivid expel of patriotism and unity. We are now facing another battle; this is the war of knowledge and advancement. To fulfill our criteria and make Bangladesh a genuinely prosperous country, we have to work side by side. Social stability is the root of any development, and now Bangladesh needs this stability more than ever.

**Ethical reshaping process**

Our social condition indeed follows our ethical choices. The current social structure of Bangladesh is facing some significant change in every aspect, and it is very challenging for the Bangladeshi population to take a particular side. The world is evolving its way so does the technological world. Now Bangladeshi people have many choices and paths to obtain various knowledge from different parts of the world. This collection and presentation of dynamic cultural interchange bring new challenges. To avoid future dilemmas and calamities, we have to come to a common ground of ethics. Government and policymakers should provide an ethical guideline for future use of fourth industrial revelations.

**Security reshaping**

The new dimension of the international arena required polished security measurements. Bangladeshi security structure needs to be improved, and there are some suggestions for reshaping the security scenario.

- Increase the digital surveillance system
- Provide complete guidance to use social media and AI
- Categories the risk factors of various security challenges
- Enlightenment of security forces by providing required training on new technologies
- Build an entire institution for digital security
- Obtain mass populations opinions in digital security

**New business models**

We have to come out with new business models that are related to the 4th IR. Bangladeshi's business structure has already increased the number of digital platforms, and we are indeed improving in this sector. Nevertheless, we need a complete system or business model that can guide us in the future. There is also some more suggestion for improving the business condition that can help reduce the business challenges, such as

- Improving the working conditions
- Increases the task efficiency
- Improve capital utilization
- Lower inventory rate
- Increased cash to cash delivery
- Increase the online banking and money transfer system
- Manage the business data and create a centralized system
- Personalize the products and more customer-friendly business structure
- New pricing models for the market

**Rebuild the communication system**

Bangladesh is still struggling in the transportation fields, and most of the industrial areas face communication leakage. We have to take initial steps to improve digital and structural communication systems.

- Provide a smooth internet connection all over Bangladesh
- Increase the road transportation system, especially in the business crowded areas
- Increase the railway facilities
- Use People to people communication fields
- Rebuild the interconnection between employees in any industry
- Share the knowledge so that the communication may increase in future.
